    only in accordance with an approved records disposition authorization
    (RDA), and that records cannot be informally transferred to unauthorized
    persons, other agencies, or private/semi-private institutions instead of
    following the RDA process.

    What conditions must be met under T.C.A. § 10-7-510 for criminal case files
    and evidence to be transferred to a university, museum, or other
    historical institution?
  topic: code
  expect_contains_any: >
    Should describe that the district attorney general (or, if in the sole
    custody of the criminal court clerk, the clerk with DA approval) may
    permanently transfer original records, documents, and evidence from a case
    or investigation to a qualifying university, museum, library, or other
    not-for-profit with a historical mission when: the institution formally
    requests them; the DA believes they are of historical significance and will
    aid public understanding; the materials have become public records; and the
    DA or clerk duplicates or photographs all documents and records in a manner
    approved by the public records commission. It should mention that
    “historical significance” is defined as events at least 20 years before
    April 18, 1994, and that confidential records cannot be transferred under
    this section.
