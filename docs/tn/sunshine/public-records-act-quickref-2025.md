## Practitioner summary
Tennessee’s Public Records Act (TPRA) makes state, county, and municipal records open for **personal inspection by any Tennessee citizen**, with limited statutory exceptions. Custodians must respond within **seven business days** by providing access, issuing a written denial with reasons, or giving a reasonable production timeline. Written requests aren’t required to **inspect** records, and agencies may recover **reasonable copy costs** consistent with the Office of Open Records Counsel (OORC) guidance and their adopted policy. Agencies cannot be forced to **create new records** and must redact confidential information rather than withhold entire records. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Key points
- **Who may request & how:** Any **Tennessee citizen** may inspect records; requests to inspect need not be in writing. Requests may be made in person, by phone, fax, mail, email (if used for official business), or an online portal where available. Agencies may require written requests **for copies**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Response deadline:** If records aren’t promptly available, the custodian must respond **within seven (7) business days** to (i) produce, (ii) deny in writing with reasons, or (iii) state the time reasonably needed. **No response** within this period counts as a **denial**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Request clarity:** Requests must be **sufficiently detailed** to identify responsive records; agencies are **not required to create** new records or compile info. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Redaction:** Confidential information must be **redacted when possible**, with the remainder released; redaction does **not** constitute creating a new record. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Costs & estimates:** Custodians may assess **reasonable costs** to produce copies and must provide a **cost estimate**; fees follow OORC methodology (§ 8-4-604) and the entity’s policy. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **ID & limits:** Agencies may require **government-issued photo ID** (if possessed) showing address for inspection/copies; requesters aren’t entitled to special/expedited access due to occupation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Failure to follow through:** If a person twice fails to **view** records within **15 business days** after notice, an entity may decline new requests for **six months** (with a good-cause exception). Nonpayment for produced copies can pause future requests until paid. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Local policies required:** Counties/municipalities must maintain a **written public records policy** (processes, redaction, fees, PRRC contact). State entities must have rules meeting the same elements. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Disruptive requests injunction:** A court may enjoin requests made with **intent to disrupt**; note this provision is **repealed effective July 1, 2025**. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
