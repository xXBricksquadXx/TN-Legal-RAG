## Practitioner summary
The OORC Schedule sets default, statewide fee guidelines for responding to Tennessee Public Records Act (TPRA) copy requests. It prohibits fees for **inspection**, allows per-page copy charges (up to **$0.15 B/W** and **$0.50 color** for standard pages), and permits **labor charges only beyond the entity’s labor threshold** (at least the first hour free). Agencies should provide **cost estimates**, use the **most economical** methods, and may recover actual out-of-pocket delivery or media costs; rates above the defaults require a documented **actual cost** analysis in the entity’s adopted policy.

## Key points
- **Inspection is free.** Fees apply to **copies** only, per the entity’s adopted policy.  
- Default copy caps for 8.5x11 or 8.5x14: **$0.15 (B/W)** and **$0.50 (color)**; duplex counts as two pages.  
- An entity may charge above the defaults **only** with a documented **actual cost** basis in its policy (it may also charge less).  
- **Labor** (locating, retrieving, reviewing, redacting, reproducing) is chargeable **only after the labor threshold** (at least the first hour free); use the lowest practicable wage rates.  
- Provide a **written estimate** on request and use the **most economical** production/delivery method feasible.  
- **Electronic delivery/media:** recover actual cost of media (e.g., flash drives); per-page costs apply only if paper must be printed (e.g., to redact).  
- **Mailing/Delivery:** if the requester won’t pick up and prepays costs, mail via **USPS First-Class** (or another agreed method) and assess related costs.  
- May recover **archive retrieval** charges and use **outside vendors** when appropriate.

- **Labor charges:** may be charged **after the first hour** of staff time (retrieval, review, redaction) using the **lowest-paid qualified employee**; time must be itemized.
