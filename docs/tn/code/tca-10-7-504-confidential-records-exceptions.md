# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-504 — Confidential records; major exceptions to TPRA

## Big picture

- § 10-7-504 is **the main list of statutory exceptions** to the Tennessee Public Records Act.
- It identifies categories of records that are **confidential by law** and not open to the public, or open only under specific conditions.
- It also has general rules about:
  - How confidential records must be destroyed,
  - When very old confidential records open up (70-year rule),
  - Employee assistance records,
  - And several security / safety related carve-outs.

County and city practice almost always involves this section when an office says, “We can’t release that because it’s confidential.”

---

## Key confidential categories (high-yield for county / local practice)

Below is a practitioner-oriented map, not a full list. Always check the statute for exact language and cross-references.

### 1. Medical and health records

- Medical records of patients in public hospitals or other publicly funded treatment programs are confidential.
- Individually identifiable health information held by the Department of Health is confidential, subject to specific disclosure authority.
- Records about the source/donation of body parts for transplant are confidential.

Use case: requests for ER charts, hospital treatment records, or health department case files.

- Investigative records of:
  - Tennessee Bureau of Investigation,
  - Office of Inspector General,
  - Certain criminal investigative files of Agriculture, Environment & Conservation,
  - Alcoholic Beverage Commission,

  are confidential while investigations are active; some open after closure, but identities of informants and undercover officers remain protected.
- Internal affairs investigative files for:
  - Department of Correction,
  - Department of Children’s Services,
  are confidential, though employees can see records if used as the basis for adverse action.

Use case: requests for TBI case files, criminal investigations, or DOC internal affairs reports.

Use case: requests for student discipline files, transcripts, or “incident reports” involving minors.

---

### 4. Attorney general and agency litigation records

- Work product, privileged communications, and certain investigatory materials in the Attorney General’s possession are confidential.
- The statute clarifies that copies of otherwise public agency records held by the AG can still be obtained from the original agency.

Use case: requester is told, “It’s with the Attorney General so we can’t give it to you.”

---

### 5. Property acquisition and valuation

- State agency appraisal and valuation records for property acquisitions are confidential during the acquisition/condemnation process.
- Discovery in litigation is still available under the Rules of Civil Procedure.

Use case: early requests for condemnation appraisals or negotiations records.

---

### 6. Procurement and bids

- Proposals and related evaluation materials in state or local procurements are confidential **until evaluations are complete / intent to award is announced**.
- Similar rules apply to certain healthcare / pharmacy / provider pricing data, with ongoing confidentiality for some detailed financial terms.

Use case: bid proposals, scoring sheets, pricing structures in RFPs.

---

### 7. Utilities, infrastructure, and security

  - Certain “private records” (e.g., customer account numbers, detailed usage data),
  - Plans or information that expose structural or operational vulnerability.

- Victim information for:
  - Sexual offenses and some violent offenses,

---

### 10. Employee assistance and mental health support

- Records of state/local employee assistance programs (EAPs) are confidential when kept separate from regular personnel files.

Use case: requests for EAP files, counseling session notes, or mental health debriefs.

---

### 11. Age-based opening of old confidential records

- As a default rule, most confidential public records become open after **70 years**, unless:
  - Another statute (especially federal) continues to prohibit/restrict disclosure, or
  - The record is about mental illness or intellectual/developmental disability services,
  - Or relates to adoption / vital records / TBI records as specially excluded.

Use case: historical or archival requests.

---

### 12. Miscellaneous special categories

§ 10-7-504 also covers, among other things:

- Certain National Guard/military security records.
- Certain proprietary or trade secret information submitted to specific programs (e.g., venture capital network at MTSU, certain food-based incubators, certain park concessionaire records, certain outfitter data, etc.).
- Specific testing materials (teacher evaluation data; some licensing exam questions/answer banks; certain CTAS and health-professional exam materials).

- Certain body-camera footage (e.g., minors in schools, interiors of some facilities and private residences), through a time-limited provision.
- Records related to the insurance verification program.

## How this doc should be used in the RAG

- Retrieval should surface this doc when the question is:
  - “Is record type X confidential under Tennessee law?”
  - “Which provision of § 10-7-504 applies to this situation?”
- The LLM should:
  - Start from this **map**,
  - Then, as needed, fall back to more detailed sources (case law, agency policies, cross-referenced statutes you add later).

## 2. You already have § 10-7-503 – small notes only

You already index:

- `docs/tn/code/tca-10-7-503-public-records-act.md`
- plus `public-records-act-quickref-2025.md`

Those are passing the TPRA evals. If you want to tighten them against the 2025 text you pasted, I’d only make sure your 503 docs clearly cover:

- The 7-business-day response rule and “no response = denial”.  
- The “no duty to create a new record” rule.  
- Redaction of confidential information and providing the redacted record.  
- **Disruptive requester injunction** process:
  - Written warning after at least five disruptive requests,
  - Petition for injunction,
  - Possible 1-year bar, with court gatekeeping for requests during that period.
- The **no destruction when a request is pending** rule and $500 fine concept.  
- The requirement for **written public records policies** (local) and **rules** (state entities).

No need to rewrite the whole thing; just make sure those themes are obvious in your summary/quick-ref content.

## 3. Example eval prompts for `cases.yaml` (adapt to your schema)

You can extend `eval/cases.yaml` with conceptual tests like these (adjust field names to match your actual YAML format):

```yaml
- id: tca-10-7-501-microfilm-authority
  query: >
    Under Tennessee law, when can a state agency replace paper records with
    microfilm, and what approvals or standards apply?
  ideal_answer_note: >
    Should mention that the head of a state department/agency may have its
    records reproduced on film, but the project must be evaluated/approved by
    the Division of Records Management, and the film/equipment must meet national
    standards for permanent records and accurately reproduce the original.

  query: >
    If a county only has a microfilm image of a deed, does Tennessee treat that
    film as the original record for evidentiary and public records purposes?
  ideal_answer_note: >
    Should say yes: a photograph/microfilm of a state, county, or municipal
    public record is treated as an original for all purposes, including evidence
    in court, and certified copies from the film are treated as certified copies
    of the original.

    Are patient medical records from a Tennessee county-owned hospital open to
    the public under the TPRA?
  ideal_answer_note: >
    Should explain that medical records of patients in state, county, and
    municipal hospitals and facilities, and publicly funded treatment records,
    are confidential under § 10-7-504 and not open to public inspection, subject
    to specific disclosure rules in other health laws.

  query: >
    Can a citizen use the Tennessee Public Records Act to get a copy of an open
    TBI criminal investigative file?
  ideal_answer_note: >
    Should state that TBI investigative records are confidential under § 10-7-504
    and not open to public inspection while the investigation is active, and that
    disclosure generally requires a court order or subpoena; some records may
    open after the investigation and prosecution are concluded, but informant and
    undercover identities remain protected.

    after 70 years from creation unless another law still prohibits disclosure,
    or the record falls into specified exceptions (e.g., adoption records,
    certain mental health or vital records, TBI records).
