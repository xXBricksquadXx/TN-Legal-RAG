## Practitioner summary

While record books are out of the office for rebinding under § 10-7-119, the affected officials:

- county clerk,
- clerk and master,
- circuit court clerk, and
- register

are **released from liability** on their official bonds (and otherwise) for safekeeping of those books.

## Key practice points

- The liability shield applies only during the period the books are properly sent out for rebinding.
- It is tied to the procedure in § 10-7-119 (order by county legislative body, transfer to binder).
- Useful citation when questions arise about who is “responsible” for books while they are at the binder.
