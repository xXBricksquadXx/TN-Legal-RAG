## Practitioner summary

This section tells the commission what must be covered in its contracts with law book publishers.
Contracts must spell out technical specifications (type size, paper, volume size, supplements, replacement volumes) and the price at which T.C.A. is sold in Tennessee.
The commission also controls the pricing of pocket parts and replacement volumes over time.

## Key practice points

- Contract specs must address both physical qualities and pricing inside Tennessee.
- Price of supplements and replacement volumes remains under commission control through contract terms.
- Useful when reviewing or drafting code-publishing contracts.
