## Practitioner summary

When a certified probate or acknowledgment has been obtained under §§ 10-7-108–109, the register (acting as transcriber) must enter it into the transcript book.

On producing the certificate, the register inserts the probate or acknowledgment and the certificate at the foot of the deed in the register’s record, as if the original deed had been produced with probate/acknowledgment attached.

## Key practice points

- The certificate is treated as if the original deed with probate/acknowledgment were before the register.
- The probate/acknowledgment is placed at the **foot of the deed** in the transcript book.
- This section completes the chain started by §§ 10-7-107–109 for curing missing probate/acknowledgment.
