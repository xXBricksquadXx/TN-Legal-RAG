## Practitioner summary

When register’s office record books are damaged or worn so that parts are destroyed, mutilated, or likely to be lost through use, the county legislative body must have them transcribed.

The register must:

- copy the records into new, well-bound books supplied by the county;
- keep the copies in the order of original registration; and
- mark at the top of each copy the original book and page(s).

If portions of a record are missing, the remaining text is copied and the missing part is indicated (e.g., with asterisks), so the transcript clearly shows where the original is incomplete.

## Key practice points

- The duty to act is triggered when damage or likely loss is present, not only after complete destruction.
- Transcripts must preserve original ordering and cross-references to book/page.
- Missing text must be clearly flagged, which helps avoid the impression that the transcript is complete.
