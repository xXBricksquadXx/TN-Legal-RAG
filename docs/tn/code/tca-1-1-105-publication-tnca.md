## Practitioner summary

This section is the core publishing mandate for Tennessee Code Annotated.
The commission is directed to plan and supervise everything needed to produce the official compilation of Tennessee’s public and general statutes, including an electronic, searchable database.

“Publication” is defined broadly to cover whatever methods are needed to develop and maintain a Tennessee Code database.

## Key practice points

- Confirms T.C.A. as the **official** compilation of Tennessee statutes of a public and general nature.
- The commission’s authority extends to electronic formats (databases), not just printed books.
- Good anchor when dealing with contracts or procurement involving publication of the code.
