## Practitioner summary

When records are transcribed under Part 1, the register and deputy register must carefully collate the transcript volumes against the original record books.

At the end of each transcript book, both must sign a joint certificate stating that:

- they have carefully collated the transcript with the original record; and
- it is a full, true, and complete copy of the original.

If part of the original record is destroyed or mutilated so it cannot be fully ascertained, they must add language indicating that the transcript is complete “so far as the same can be ascertained from its burned or mutilated condition.”

Except as provided in §§ 10-7-116 and 10-7-118, the transcript then has the same legal effect as the original record.

## Key practice points

- Both the register and deputy register must participate in collation and certification.
- The certificate language is important evidence of the transcript’s reliability.
- A properly certified transcript has the same legal effect as the original record, subject to the statutory exceptions.
