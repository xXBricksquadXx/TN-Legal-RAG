## Practitioner summary

This section provides an alternate route to get a probate or acknowledgment into the record when the original instrument is not available to the person requesting it.

Any interested person may:

- apply to the clerk of the court where the probate was made,
- swear that the original instrument is not in their possession, power, or control, and
- demand and receive a certified transcript of the probate or acknowledgment from the clerk.

That certified transcript can then be used to complete the record in the register’s books.

## Key practice points

- The applicant must make an oath that they do not have the original in their possession, power, or control.
- The clerk’s duty is to provide a **certified transcript** of the probate/acknowledgment.
- Together with §§ 10-7-107–108, this section makes sure the probate/acknowledgment can be added even when the original instrument cannot be produced.
