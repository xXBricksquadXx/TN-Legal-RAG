## Practitioner summary

After transcript books are created, the register must properly index them.

The statute is short but important: it ensures that the new transcript books are integrated into the register’s indexing system so that parties can actually locate the transcribed records.

## Key practice points

- Indexing is mandatory, not optional.
- Transcript books must be indexed just like other record books.
- Useful citation when arguing that a county must treat transcript volumes as fully functional record books.
