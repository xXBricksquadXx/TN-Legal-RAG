# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-508 — Access for state officials; archival value; confidential records

## Access authority for key officials

Regardless of whether records are open to the public, the following officials must be given access to **any public records or writings**:

- Secretary of state (or designee),
- State librarian and archivist,
- Comptroller of the treasury (or designee) **for audit purposes**.

They must keep **privileged or confidential information** they see inviolate and recognize any legal confidentiality applied to the record.

## Archival review of confidential records

- The **state librarian and archivist** (or a designated archivist) and the **secretary of state** (or a records analyst) may examine confidential public records in order to:
  - Determine, in consultation with the **agency head**, whether the records have **archival value**, and
  - Check whether records have been properly filed or designated as confidential.
- If they conclude that some administrative or otherwise open records have been wrongly labeled “confidential,” those records must be **reclassified** to the appropriate access level.
- Access for these appraisal purposes is to be built into the **retention schedules** and **records disposition authorizations** approved by the public records commission.

## Retention or disposal after appraisal

- Records determined to have archival value are retained in line with:
  - The public records commission’s rules for archival records, and
  - The applicable records disposition authorizations.
- Confidential records found **not** to be of archival value must be disposed of by authorized means, under approved disposition authorizations.

## Example questions this doc should help answer

- “Can the state archivist look at confidential agency files in Tennessee?”
- “Who decides if a confidential record has archival value, and what happens if something is mislabeled as confidential?”
- “How are non-archival confidential records supposed to be disposed of?”
