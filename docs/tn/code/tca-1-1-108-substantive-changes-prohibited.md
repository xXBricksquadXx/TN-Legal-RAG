## Practitioner summary

This is the “no substantive edits” rule for codification.

The commission cannot change the substance of acts when preparing T.C.A., but it **can**:

- renumber and rearrange sections;
- update cross-references and headings;
- correct obvious typos and standardize style;
- update references to agencies when powers are transferred; and
- omit things like enacting clauses, severability clauses, captions, etc.

If there is a proven enrollment error (the enrolled act differs from the bill actually passed), the commission does not codify it but instead inserts a compiler’s note describing the problem based on a certificate from the secretary of state.

## Key practice points

- Courts and practitioners can rely on T.C.A. not to have changed the substantive law during codification.
- Enrollment errors are flagged with compiler’s notes rather than silently “fixed.”
- The long list of allowed changes is a checklist for what the commission may adjust without altering substance.
