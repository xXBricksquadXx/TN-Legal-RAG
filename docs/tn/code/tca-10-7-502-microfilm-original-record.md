# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-502 — Photographic copy deemed original record

## Plain-language rule

- A photograph, microphotograph, or photographic film of a **state, county, or municipal** public record is treated as an **original record for all purposes**, including use as evidence in court or before an agency.
- A certified copy made from that film is treated the same as a certified copy from the original.

## Practice notes

- This section is what lets clerks and registers rely on film/digital copies in litigation and in day-to-day operations.
- For TPRA purposes, a requester asking for “the original” may be given access to the film or a printout from the film and this section backs that up legally.
- Pairs with:
  - § 10-7-501 (state authority to microfilm),
  - §§ 10-7-116 and 10-7-118 (transcripts and transcribed records as evidence).

## Example questions this doc should help answer

- “If the paper deed book is gone but the county has microfilm, is the microfilm legally the ‘original’?”
- “Can a Tennessee court accept a certified copy made from microfilm of a county record?”
- “Does a citizen have to be allowed to see the old physical book if a film copy exists?”
