## Practitioner summary

This section sets who runs the commission:

- The **chief justice** serves as chair of the Tennessee code commission.
- The **revisor of statutes** in the office of legal services for the general assembly serves as the commission’s executive secretary.

## Key practice points

- Leadership is fixed by statute; the chair is not elected from among the members.
- The “executive secretary” role is tied to the revisor of statutes, not a free-floating staff position.
