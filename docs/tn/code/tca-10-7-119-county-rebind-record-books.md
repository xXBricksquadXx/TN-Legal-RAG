## Practitioner summary

When the county legislative body determines that record books in the register’s office, county clerk, clerk and master, or circuit court clerk need rebinding to preserve them, it may:

- authorize the chair of the county legislative body to take charge of the books and receipt for them,
- send them to a competent in-state bookbinding firm, and
- require the firm to rebind and return them as soon as possible.

## Key practice points

- Applies to record books in **multiple** county offices (register, county clerk, clerk and master, circuit court clerk).
- The county legislative body controls the decision and process.
- There must be receipts both when the chair takes custody and when the binder receives the books.
