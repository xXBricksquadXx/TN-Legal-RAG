# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-505 — Denial of access; court procedures; fees

## Plain-language rule

- If a Tennessee citizen is denied access to a public record under § 10-7-503 (in whole or in part), the citizen can file a **court petition** to challenge that denial.
- Venue:
  - For **county/municipal** records: chancery or circuit court (or other equity court) in the county where the records are located.
  - For **state** records: chancery or circuit court in Davidson County; or in the county where the records are located; or in the petitioner's county of residence (any court in that county with equity jurisdiction).
- The court should act **expeditiously**:
  - On request, it issues a **show-cause order** requiring the custodian to appear.
  - Formal written responses and normal response deadlines are not required.
  - The court can review the records **in camera** (under seal) if needed.

## Burden of proof and standard

- The **burden is on the government** to justify nondisclosure.
- The justification must be proved by a **preponderance of the evidence**.

## Court powers and construction

- The court must issue **written findings of fact and conclusions of law**.
- The court may use full **injunctive remedies** to enforce access.
- The section must be **broadly construed** to give “the fullest possible public access” to public records.

## Effect of judgment and appeals

- If the petitioner wins:
  - The court shall order the records produced, **unless**:
    1. A notice of appeal is timely filed; and
    2. The court certifies there is a **substantial legal issue** that should be resolved by the appellate courts.

## Immunity and fee shifting

- A public official who releases records as required by this part is **not civilly or criminally liable** and is not responsible for damages caused by the release.
- If the court finds the governmental entity (or its agent):
  - **Knew the record was public**, and
  - **Willfully refused** to disclose it,
  - the court **may** assess all reasonable costs of obtaining the record, including **reasonable attorney’s fees**, against the nondisclosing entity.
- In deciding willfulness, the court may consider any guidance the custodian received from the **Office of Open Records Counsel**.

## Example questions this doc should help answer

- “Where do I file if a Tennessee county denies my TPRA request?”
- “Who has the burden of proof when I sue over a records denial?”
- “Can a Tennessee court award attorney’s fees for a willful TPRA violation, and under what standard?”
- “Is a records custodian personally liable if they release records they’re legally required to disclose?”
