# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-507 — Access to conviction records

## Plain-language rule

- Any public official who has charge, custody, or control of **public records of convictions** for:
  - Traffic violations, or
  - Any other state, county, or municipal public offenses,
- must make copies of those records available to **any citizen**, upon request during regular office hours.

## Fees

- The official may charge a **reasonable fee per copy** designed to defray the cost of producing and delivering the copies.

## Practice notes

- This is a specific, affirmative access requirement for **conviction records** (as opposed to pending charges).
- It sits alongside the broader TPRA rules but makes clear that conviction records must be copied for requesters, subject to reasonable copy charges.

## Example questions this doc should help answer

- “Can a Tennessee clerk refuse to provide me a copy of a traffic conviction record?”
- “May a court clerk charge fees for copies of conviction histories, and on what basis?”
