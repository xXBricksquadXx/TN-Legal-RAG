## Practitioner summary

County officials may provide **computer access and remote electronic access** (inquiry only) to records maintained on computer storage media.

Key conditions:

- Officials may charge a **reasonable fee** sufficient only to recover the cost of providing remote access (not storage/maintenance).
- No fee may be charged for records viewed at the office where they are stored.
- Any remote-access system must prevent users from altering, deleting, or impairing records.
- Before offering remote access, the official must file a statement with the comptroller of the treasury describing equipment, software, and protective procedures (with exceptions for already-implemented systems).
- Once remote access is in place, it must be available to all members of the public (including proprietary users) who pay the applicable fee.
- Remote access cannot be provided to records that are confidential by statute.
- This section supersedes conflicting private acts.

## Key practice points

- “Reasonable fee” is explicitly limited to the cost of providing access, not the whole system.
- In-person viewing at the office remains free.
- Equal access: no discrimination between “regular” users and commercial/proprietary users.
- Important backbone section for any county remote records portal.
