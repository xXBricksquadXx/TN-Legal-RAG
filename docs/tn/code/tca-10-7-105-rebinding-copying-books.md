## Practitioner summary

This section backs up § 10-7-104 by assigning responsibility and cost.

- County registers have a duty to see that their books are copied when, in the judgment of the county legislative body, the books are so worn or mutilated that they need rebinding or copying.
- County legislative bodies must appropriate the necessary funds to pay for the rebinding or copying.

## Key practice points

- The trigger is the **county legislative body’s judgment** about the condition of the books.
- Both the register and the county legislative body have roles: the register initiates, the county funds.
- This section is a good citation when pushing back on a county that does not want to fund preservation/copying of worn record books.
