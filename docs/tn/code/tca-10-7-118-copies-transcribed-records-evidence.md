## Practitioner summary

When county records are transcribed under authority of the county legislative body (because originals are mutilated, defaced, or for other reasons), a **certified copy from the transcribed records**:

- is admissible as evidence in Tennessee courts; and
- has the same validity as if the certified copy were made from the original record,

**subject to § 10-7-116** (the rule about conflicts between original and transcript).

## Key practice points

- Certified copies from transcribed books are fully usable as evidence.
- Their validity is equated with certified copies from original books, unless § 10-7-116 shows a material variance.
- This is a core “transcripts are real records” provision for litigation.
