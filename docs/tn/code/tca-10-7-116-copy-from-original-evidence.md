## Practitioner summary

If someone is dissatisfied with the transcript in the register's office and wants access to the original record, the **clerk** must provide a transcript from the original.

However, that transcript from the original is **only admissible** in evidence if, on examination, it is found that the register's transcript **varies from the original**, and that the variance **alters the meaning and substance** of a deed or title in litigation.

## Key practice points

- A party unhappy with the register’s transcript can go back to the original in the clerk’s office.
- The “second” transcript from the original only comes into evidence if:
  - there is a variance between the original and the register’s transcript, and
  - the variance affects meaning/substance in a litigated deed/title.
- This section protects reliance on the register’s transcript, while providing a safety valve if the transcript is materially wrong.
