## Practitioner summary

If a registered instrument exists in someone’s possession but was recorded without its probate or acknowledgment, this section allows the omission to be cured.

The person holding the instrument may:

- produce it to the register while the register is transcribing, or
- produce it after the transcript is completed,

and have the probate or acknowledgment entered of record.

## Key practice points

- Applies when the **instrument itself** is available in the person’s possession.
- The register can add the missing probate/acknowledgment either during or after transcription.
- Works hand-in-glove with § 10-7-107’s instruction to leave room in the transcript.
