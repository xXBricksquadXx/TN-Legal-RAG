## Practitioner summary

This section puts the duty on the county to supply proper books for the register’s office.

On the register’s demand, the county legislative body must procure well-bound books for recording instruments that must be registered by law. The trustee pays the cost on the county mayor’s warrant, after the register presents:

- a receipt from the seller, and
- an affidavit that the register has paid or is obligated to pay the amount in the receipt.

## Key practice points

- The county, not the register personally, bears the cost of record books.
- The register must document the purchase (receipt) and sworn payment obligation to trigger payment.
- This section is useful any time there is a dispute about who must fund recording books or how payment is processed.
