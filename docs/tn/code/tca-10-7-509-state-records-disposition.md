# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-509 — Disposition of records

## Plain-language rule

- All **state records** may be disposed of **only** through an **approved records disposition authorization** (RDA).
- Records that are authorized for destruction must:
  - Be disposed of strictly according to the applicable RDA, and
  - **Not** be:
    - Given to any unauthorized person,
    - Transferred to another agency or political subdivision, or
    - Given to a private or semi-private institution.

## Practice notes

- This section is aimed at **state** records (not directly local), but it frames the rule that disposition is a **formal, controlled process** governed by RDAs reviewed by the public records commission.
- It underpins the idea that agencies cannot “get rid of” records informally, including by handing them off to private parties outside an RDA.

## Example questions this doc should help answer

- “Can a Tennessee state agency donate old files to a private group instead of destroying them?”
- “Is destruction or transfer of state records allowed without an approved records disposition authorization?”
