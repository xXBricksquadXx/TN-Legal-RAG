## Practitioner summary

This section authorizes government officials to keep required records on computer or removable storage media (including electronic formats) instead of bound books or paper, if certain conditions are met:

- Records must remain **available for public inspection** unless confidential by law.
- **Due care is taken** to maintain public records during the required retention period.
- All **daily data** must be **copied to computer storage media** each day, and media more than one week old must be **stored at a location other than** the office where the records are used.
- The official must be able to **provide a paper copy** of the information when needed or requested.
- Officials are not required to sell or provide the physical media itself.

In large counties (population > 800,000 by census), assessor-of-property computer data about assessments must be made available to the public at cost within 30 days of request.


## Key practice points

- This is the core authority for electronic record-keeping for Tennessee government offices.
- Daily backup and off-site storage are explicitly required.
- The right of the public to obtain **paper copies** is preserved.
- Special rule for large counties: assessment data must be made available at cost within 30 days.
