# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-510 — Transfer of criminal case materials to historical institutions

## When original criminal case materials can be transferred

A **district attorney general** may permanently transfer custody and ownership of original records, documents, and physical evidence from a particular criminal case or investigation to a:

- University or other institution of higher education,
- Museum,
- Library, or
- Other not-for-profit corporation whose primary purpose is preserving and displaying items of historical significance,

if all of the following are true:

1. The receiving institution has **formally requested** the materials.
2. In the DA’s opinion, the materials are of **historical significance**, and displaying them would enhance public understanding of a time or event.
3. The materials have, **by operation of law, become public records**.
4. The DA or clerk **duplicates or photographs all documents and records** before transfer in a manner approved by the public records commission.

## Transfers from criminal court clerks

- If the originals are in the **sole custody of the criminal court clerk**, the clerk may transfer them with:
  - Approval of the district attorney general, and
  - Written notice of the proposed transfer to the presiding officer of the relevant legislative body before the transfer.

## Process and effect

- Once a transfer is approved:
  - The **district attorney general** decides the date, time, and method of transfer.
  - After transfer, anyone wishing to view the materials must do so **at the receiving institution**, not from the court/DA.

## Definition of “historical significance”

- For this section, an event is of “historical significance” if the event giving rise to the materials **occurred at least 20 years before April 18, 1994**.

## Limitations

- This section **does not apply** to records or documents made confidential by any law. Confidential materials remain subject to their own restrictions.

## Example questions this doc should help answer

- “Can a Tennessee DA donate old case files and evidence from a famous case to a university archive?”
- “What conditions must be met before original criminal case materials can be transferred for historical display?”
- “Where does the public go to view criminal case materials once they’ve been transferred under § 10-7-510?”
