## Practitioner summary

Once transcripts have been made, the original record books from which the transcripts were created must be deposited in the clerk’s office of the county.

This keeps the fragile originals in a central, presumably safer office while the register’s office works with the new transcript books.

## Key practice points

- Applies to the original records used to create the transcript.
- The originals move to the county clerk’s office after transcription.
- Good citation when clarifying custody and location of old, fragile volumes.
