## Practitioner summary

This section creates the Tennessee code commission and fixes its basic membership.
The commission has five members:

- the chief justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court;
- the attorney general and reporter;
- a director of the office of legal services for the general assembly; and
- two additional members appointed by the chief justice.

Any vacancy in the appointed positions is filled by appointment from the chief justice.

## Key practice points

- There are always five commissioners by statute.
- Only the two “other members” are purely appointed; the other three are ex officio.
- When one of the appointed members leaves for any reason, the chief justice selects the replacement.
