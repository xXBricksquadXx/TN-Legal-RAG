# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-506 — Copies and commercial-value public records

## Plain-language rule (general copying rights)

- Anyone who has the right to inspect a public record also has the right to:
  - Take **extracts or make copies**, and
  - Make **photographs or photostats**,
- while the record is in the lawful custodian’s possession.
- The custodian may adopt and enforce **reasonable rules** governing how extracts, copies, and photographs are made.

## Notice to county assessor when state releases assessor data

- If a **state agency** releases public records that **originate with the county assessor of property**:
  - Within 10 days, the state agency must notify the county assessor in writing,
  - Telling the assessor which records were released and to whom (name and address).
- This notice requirement does **not** apply to releases of county or city **summary assessment information**.

## Records with commercial value (computer-generated maps / GIS, etc.)

- If a request seeks a copy of a public record that:
  - Has **commercial value**, and
  - Requires reproduction of all or part of a **computer-generated map or similar geographic data** developed with public funds,
- then the responsible state department/agency or political subdivision may charge **additional reasonable fees** beyond ordinary copy charges.

### Additional development-cost fees

- Extra fees must relate to actual **development costs** of the map/data, and may include:
  - Labor costs;
  - Design, development, testing, implementation, and training;
  - Costs to keep the data accurate, complete, and current (including updates and changes).
- Development-cost recovery is capped at **10%** of total development costs, unless:
  - For state agencies: the **Information Systems Council (ISC)** approves a business plan for 10–20% recovery and the General Assembly approves it.
  - For local governments: the **local governing body** approves the plan, then the ISC approves it.
- These costs are subject to audit by the **comptroller of the treasury**, and once recouped, fees should be adjusted to cover only **maintenance**, not further development.

### Who pays and who is exempt

- The extra “commercial value” fees **cannot** be charged:
  - To individuals requesting copies for **non-business** use, or
  - To the **news media** requesting information for news-gathering (they may be charged only **reproduction cost**).
- “Record that has commercial value” means a record requested for any purpose other than:
  - A non-business individual use, or
  - A news-gathering use by the news media.

## Example questions this doc should help answer

- “Can I use my own phone to photograph open records in Tennessee?”
- “Can a county GIS department charge me more than standard copy fees for shapefiles or parcel maps I’m using in a business project?”
- “Do extra GIS fees apply if I just want a copy for my personal use?”
