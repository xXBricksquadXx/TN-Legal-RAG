## Practitioner summary

This section gives the Tennessee code commission broad authority to do whatever is needed to produce and publish the revised compilation of Tennessee statutes, including:

- negotiating and executing contracts with law book publishers, and
- arranging for editing, annotation, indexing, printing, binding, sale, and distribution, including electronic databases.

Existing contracts for these purposes are preserved and not impaired.

## Key practice points

- Confirms the commission’s contracting authority on behalf of the state for code publication.
- Explicitly protects obligations of prior contracts, including for electronic databases.
- Good citation when someone questions whether the commission can enter a particular publishing contract.
