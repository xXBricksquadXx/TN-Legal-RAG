## Practitioner summary

This definition provision tells you what “records” means in Part 1 of the public records chapter.
It includes:

- records of the county legislative body;
- records of the common law, circuit, criminal, and chancery courts;
- the register’s books; and
- the surveyor’s and entry taker’s books,

plus all other public records that the law requires to be kept in the courts of Tennessee.

## Key practice points

- The definition is broad and court-focused: it sweeps in county legislative and court records, plus traditional land/title books.
- When Part 1 talks about preserving or transcribing “records,” it means this full list, not just a narrow subset.
- Use this section when someone tries to argue that a particular county/court record is outside the Part 1 preservation rules.
