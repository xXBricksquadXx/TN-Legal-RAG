## Practitioner summary

When the register, acting as transcriber, discovers that an instrument in the original record was registered without its probate or acknowledgment, the register must leave space in the transcript.

In other words, the register does not “fix” the omission in the text itself but must leave enough blank space in the transcript book so that the probate or acknowledgment can later be recorded.

## Key practice points

- The section assumes the original omission is discovered during transcription.
- The remedy is to reserve room in the transcript, not to invent or guess at the missing probate/acknowledgment.
- This section pairs with §§ 10-7-108 and 10-7-109, which describe how the missing probate/acknowledgment can later be supplied.
