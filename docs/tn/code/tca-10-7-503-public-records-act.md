## Practitioner summary
Core TPRA section defining **public records** and setting baseline access rules. Records are **presumed open to TN citizens** for **personal inspection** during business hours; custodians must **promptly** provide access or, if not practicable, respond within **7 business days** to produce, deny with reasons, or provide a reasonable time estimate. Agencies may **not require a written request to view**, may require written/form requests **for copies**, and may recover **reasonable copy costs** with **pre-estimates**. The statute codifies **redaction (not new record creation)**, bars outsourcing to avoid disclosure, authorizes **injunctive relief** against **intent-to-disrupt** requesters (with procedural safeguards), requires **local written public records policies**, and imposes **litigation hold/anti-destruction** rules once a request is pending.

## Key points
- **Definitions & scope:** “Public/state records” cover all media created/received in official business; **devices (phones/computers)** themselves are **not** records. Defines **PRRC** and **records custodian** roles.  
- **Right to inspect:** All state/county/municipal records open to any **TN citizen** during business hours (hospital hours = admin office hours).  
- **7-business-day rule:** If prompt inspection isn’t practicable, the custodian must within **7 business days**: (i) produce, (ii) **deny in writing with basis**, or (iii) give a **time estimate** (form may be OORC’s). **No response = denial** (right to sue under § 10-7-505).  
- **No duty to create new records:** Requests must be **sufficiently detailed**; entities need not **compile or create** new records.  
- **Redaction:** Confidential info must be **redacted where possible** and the remainder released; **redaction isn’t creating** a new record. Associated copy/labor costs handled per law.  
- **No avoidance via contracts:** Agencies cannot contract out duties to **evade** disclosure obligations.  
- **Viewing vs. copies:**  
  - **Viewing:** No written request or viewing charge may be required (unless another law says so). Requests to **view** can be in person, phone, email, mail, or portal if used for official business.  
  - **Copies:** An entity **may require** written or form requests; if it requires “in writing,” it must accept **mail, email (if used for business), or portal** submissions and provide forms **expeditiously** if forms are required.  
  - **ID:** May require **government photo ID with address** (if possessed) or other proof of **TN residency**.  
  - **Repeat no-shows / nonpayment:** Two viewing no-shows within **6 months** → entity may decline new requests for **6 months** (good-cause exception). Unpaid copy costs after estimate/consent → entity may decline further requests until paid.  
- **Costs & estimates:** Custodians may charge **reasonable costs** per **OORC methodology (§ 8-4-604)** and must give an **estimate** before producing copies.  
- **Disruptive-request injunction:** Custodian may petition court to **enjoin** requests made with **intent to disrupt** (requires prior written notice after the **5th** such request; court may enjoin up to **1 year**; requester may petition for leave to file; prevailing custodian may recover **labor costs during pendency**). *(Note: (a)(7)(C)(vi) deleted by 2025 amendment.)*  
- **Law enforcement personnel files:** Open for inspection, but custodian must **notify the officer within 3 days** after inspection and record requester identity/contact details.  
- **Certain “organizations” records confidential:** For specified quasi-public organizations meeting criteria, records are confidential **if** annual **Comptroller audit** with detailed compensation/fees disclosures is performed; the **audit itself is public**.  
- **Local/state policies:**  
  - **Counties/municipalities:** By **July 1, 2018**, must adopt a **written public records policy** (request process/forms, response & redaction practices, **fee schedule**, **PRRC contact**).  
  - **State entities:** By **Jan. 1, 2019**, must **promulgate rules** (UAPA) that meet the same elements.  
- **Destruction/holds & retention:**  
  - **No destruction** when the entity **knows** records are subject to a **pending** TPRA request; contact PRRC before authorizing destruction.  
  - Violations may be **fined up to $500**; criminal liability under **§ 39-16-504** unaffected.  
  - Routine disposal per retention schedules allowed when there’s **no knowledge** of a pending request.  
  - **Request correspondence** (forms, emails, letters, faxes, attachments) must be **retained ≥ 12 months** (does not apply to the underlying records).
