# Tenn. Code Ann. § 10-7-501 — Reproduction of state records on film

## Plain-language rule

- The head of any state department, commission, board, or agency may have records photographed, microfilmed, or otherwise reproduced on film.
- The microfilm project has to be reviewed/approved by the Division of Records Management in the Department of State.
- The film and equipment must meet national standards for permanent photographic records and must accurately reproduce the original in all details.

## Practice notes (TN records / county context)

- This is mainly **state-level** authority, but it explains why requesters often see microfilm instead of old paper originals.
- If a requester challenges “why is this on microfilm / is this a real record?”, this section supports the agency’s use of microfilm for preservation.
- County practitioners should know this section exists when dealing with very old state records or when a state agency offers microfilm as the inspection/copy format.

## Example questions this doc should help answer

- “Can a Tennessee state agency convert permanent records to microfilm instead of keeping the paper?”
- “Who has to sign off on a state microfilm project?”
- “If I’m inspecting an old state record that’s on film, is that considered the official record?”
