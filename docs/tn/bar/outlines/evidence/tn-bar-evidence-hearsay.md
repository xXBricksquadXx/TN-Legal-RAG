## Rule statement (exam short)
Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In TN, the definition and exceptions largely track the FRE with some state distinctions.

## Common exceptions (TN)
- Present sense impression; excited utterance; then-existing condition
- Statements for medical diagnosis/treatment
- Business records; public records
- Prior testimony (unavailability required)

## TN vs FRE notes
- TN retains some common-law nuances on confrontation & 804 unavailability; confirm precise TN Rule language during analysis.
