## Practitioner summary
Chapter 1360-01-02 **defines the types of rules** Tennessee agencies can file with the Secretary of State under the UAPA and maps each type to the required **filing form**. It distinguishes **Rulemaking Hearing Rules** (after a public hearing), **Proposed Rules** (no hearing), and **Emergency Rules** (limited circumstances), and lists the statutory bases for each. Practically, this is the **taxonomy + form index** you use before drafting/submitting rule text. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Key points
- **“Rules” = three types:** Rulemaking hearing rules, proposed rules, and emergency rules. Each uses its **own form**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Rulemaking Hearing Rules → Form SS-7039:** Filed **after a rulemaking hearing** held per **T.C.A. § 4-5-202**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Proposed Rules → Form SS-7038:** Filed **without a rulemaking hearing** under **T.C.A. § 4-5-205**. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Emergency Rules → Form SS-7040:** Allowed under **T.C.A. § 4-5-208(a)** when one of the following applies:  
  - **Immediate danger** to public health, safety, or welfare; ordinary rulemaking would not adequately protect the public.  
  - The rule **delays the effective date** of another not-yet-effective rule.  
  - **Constitution or court order** requires it.  
  - **Federal requirement** where ordinary rulemaking could jeopardize a federal program or funds.  
  - **Statutory deadline** to implement rules within a period that precludes ordinary procedures. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
