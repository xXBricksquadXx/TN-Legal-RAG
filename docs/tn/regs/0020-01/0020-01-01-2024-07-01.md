## Practitioner summary
This rule supplies the **defined terms** used across the Tennessee State Board of Accountancy’s Chapter 0020-01 (Licensing & Registration) and subsequent chapters. It anchors key concepts (e.g., **“financial statements,” “license,” “report,” “resident manager,”** and cross-references to **T.C.A. § 62-1-103** for statutory definitions such as *attest*, *board*, and *CPA*). These definitions matter for **CPA/PA licensure, firm permits, practice restrictions, reporting, and compliance checks** that hinge on precise meanings. Notable items include the **six-month** threshold for an **“expired license”** and a requirement that **each office location have a CPA resident manager** responsible for compliance. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Key points
- **Scope & cross-reference:** Definitions here apply to this chapter **and each subsequent chapter**; several terms (e.g., **attest, board, certificate, CPA, PA, registration, report**) incorporate meanings **by reference to T.C.A. § 62-1-103**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Expired license:** Defined as **more than six (6) months** past the expiration date (affects renewal/reinstatement consequences elsewhere in the rules). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Financial statements:** Includes statements, notes, and supplementary info presenting position/results/cash flows under GAAP or another comprehensive basis; **excludes** incidental management-advisory data and **excludes tax returns/supporting schedules**. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **License / permit:** “License” covers a **certificate (62-1-107)**, **firm permit (62-1-108)**, or **registration (62-1-109)**, including corresponding prior-law instruments; “permit” specifically covers CPA/PA **firm** practice. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Report:** Uses the **statutory definition** and clarifies that standard report language from **authoritative bodies** implies assurance/expertise for the referenced information. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Resident manager:** Every **office location** must designate a **CPA resident manager** accountable for that office’s compliance; one licensee may serve multiple locations. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

- **Administrative history:** Rule lineage reflects multiple amendments dating back to 1981; notable changes include the **six-month** “expired license” threshold and broadened “license” definition. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
