## Practitioner summary
These **Uniform Rules** set the default procedural playbook for **contested cases** under Tennessee’s UAPA when an agency has adopted them and when APD administrative judges preside. Highlights: broad **scope** (with deference to superseding law/agency rules), **e-filing and service** norms, structured **prehearing motions**, **discovery** guided by TRCP, **subpoena** practice, **default/uncontested** consequences, **evidence** standards keyed to **T.C.A. § 4-5-313**, optional **costs** motions when authorized by statute, and post-order processes (**record, reconsideration/stays, filing of final orders**). The **Code of Judicial Conduct** provision applies to **all** state administrative judges and hearing officers. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Key points
- **Scope & hierarchy.** Applies to agencies that adopt them; superseding federal/state law or a contrary lawfully adopted agency rule controls. TRCP may be consulted where the rules are silent; **Code of Judicial Conduct** (-.20) applies universally. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Filing & service.** Pleadings must be **signed** (electronic signature allowed) and can be **filed electronically or by fax**; filings received by **11:59 p.m. CT** on a business day count as filed that day. Redact PII/PHI; serve all parties and include a **proof of service** statement. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Commencement & notice.** Rules specify initiation of contested cases and **service of notice of hearing**; adequacy of notice informs default decisions. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Discovery.** Encouraged to proceed **informally** where possible; motions are decided by the administrative judge under the UAPA and **TRCP**; discovery materials generally are **not filed** unless used by the judge. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Intervention.** Petition must state facts/legal theories; judge weighs interest/common issues/adequacy of representation/manageability; AG notice required if validity of a statute/rule is challenged. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Subpoenas.** Available per chapter (not quoted here), with practice integrated into hearings. (See table of contents confirming availability.) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Default & uncontested proceedings.** After proof of notice, failure to appear/participate or to obey lawful orders can lead to **default**; if petitioner defaults, petitioner’s issues may be **dismissed**; respondent default → case may proceed **uncontested**. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Evidence.** Witness testimony is in **open hearing** unless law/rule provides otherwise; admissibility follows **T.C.A. § 4-5-313**. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Requests for costs (new in 2024).** Where a statute authorizes costs/fees and an APD judge sits alone, a party may move for **actual and reasonable costs/attorney’s fees** with an affidavit (Rule 1.5 factors); APD may provide a **bill of costs**. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **After the hearing.** Rules address the **record**, **petitions for reconsideration and stays** to multi-member agencies, and **filing of final orders**. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Notes / scope
- **Effective date.** Latest amendments filed **Jan. 8, 2024** and **effective Apr. 7, 2024**. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- **Adoption required.** Agencies typically **adopt** the Uniform Rules to use them; some agencies have **supplemental or contrary rules** under **T.C.A. § 4-5-219(d)**—check the agency’s own procedural rules. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **Practice tip.** When APD judges preside, follow APD-specific filing/service details and use **TRCP** for gaps; confirm any agency-specific deviations before relying on defaults. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
